🔄 Project Steps
1️⃣ Load Dataset (Python)

Loaded dataset using pandas.read_csv()

Performed initial inspection (head, info, describe)

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified missing values and distribution patterns

Visualized key variables and correlations

Detected trends and anomalies

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing/duplicate values

Fixed data types and standardized formats

Removed outliers where necessary

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Imported cleaned dataset into databases

Performed:

Filtering, sorting, grouping

Joins and subqueries

Window functions

KPI calculations and business-level summaries

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Developed an interactive dashboard showing:

KPIs

Trend visualizations

Category-level breakdowns

Filters and slicers for user interaction
